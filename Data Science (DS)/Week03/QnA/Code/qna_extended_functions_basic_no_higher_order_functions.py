Ride Sharing System
------------------
This program implements a ride-sharing service that helps match riders with nearby drivers based on
distance and fare criteria. It includes functionality to filter drivers by distance, calculate total
trip distances, validate inputs, and find the most economical option for the rider.

Key features:
- Filter drivers within a specified radius
- Calculate total trip distances
- Validate distance and fare inputs
- Display driver information
- Calculate average fares
- Find the driver with the lowest fare
