Exercise: Smart Device Home System

Objective:
This exercise models a "Smart Device" system to manage various connected devices in a smart home. 
Each device has attributes such as name, type, location, and power status. It also calculates 
total power consumption across all devices.

Concepts Covered:
1. Instance attributes for device-specific information (e.g., name, type, location, wattage).
2. Class attributes to track shared properties (e.g., total connected devices, total power consumption).
3. Instance methods to control device power state and retrieve device information.
4. Class methods to register devices and update global properties like power consumption.
5. Static methods to provide general utilities unrelated to specific instances.
6. Encapsulation using private attributes to protect the power status of devices.

"""

class SmartDevice:
    """
    A class to represent a smart device in a connected home system.
    Tracks device-specific details and global system information like power consumption.

    Class Attributes:
    - connected_devices: Tracks the total number of devices registered.
    - total_power_consumption: Tracks the total power usage across all devices.

    Instance Attributes:
    - name: The name of the device.
    - device_type: The type of device (e.g., Light, Thermostat).
    - location: The location of the device (e.g., Living Room, Kitchen).
    - wattage: The power consumption of the device in watts.
    - __power_status: (Private) Tracks whether the device is ON or OFF.
